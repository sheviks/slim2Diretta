# CLAUDE.md - slim2diretta

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

**slim2diretta** is a native LMS (Slimproto) player with Diretta output in a mono-process architecture. It replaces the couple squeezelite + squeeze2diretta-wrapper with a single binary that implements Slimproto directly and feeds DirettaSync without an intermediate pipe.

**License**: MIT (no GPL code copied). Slimproto protocol implemented from public documentation.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build (auto-detects architecture and SDK)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Specific architecture variants
cmake -DARCH_NAME=x64-linux-15v3 ..       # x64 AVX2 (most common)
cmake -DARCH_NAME=aarch64-linux-15 ..     # Raspberry Pi 4
cmake -DARCH_NAME=aarch64-linux-15k16 ..  # Raspberry Pi 5 (16KB pages)

# SDK v149+ also ships GCC16-built variants (x64-linux-16v3/16v4/16zen4,
# aarch64-linux-16k4/16k16, riscv64-linux-16) alongside the GCC15 ones
# auto-detected by default. Reported to measurably improve sound quality
# on some setups (GitHub issue #10) but untested against an older host
# toolchain — CMake warns if the system gcc is older than the selected
# variant's GCC major version. Opt in explicitly if you want to try it:
cmake -DARCH_NAME=x64-linux-16v3 ..       # x64 AVX2, GCC16-built lib

# Same override via install.sh (ARCH_NAME env var, mirrors the LLVM=1 convention):
env ARCH_NAME=x64-linux-16v3 ./install.sh -b

# Custom SDK path
export DIRETTA_SDK_PATH=/path/to/DirettaHostSDK_149
cmake ..

# Clang + LTO (recommended for best audio quality)
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DENABLE_LTO=ON ..
```

## Running

```bash
# List available Diretta targets
sudo ./slim2diretta --list-targets

# Basic usage
sudo ./slim2diretta -s <lms-ip> --target 1

# With player name and verbose
sudo ./slim2diretta -s <lms-ip> --target 1 -n "Living Room" -v

# With CPU affinity (single core each — cores 2,3,4 isolated via isolcpus=2,3,4)
sudo ./slim2diretta --target 1 --cpu-audio 2 --cpu-decode 3 --cpu-other 4

# Multi-core affinity (v1.3.0+): audio thread can float between cores 2,3
sudo ./slim2diretta --target 1 --cpu-audio 2,3 --cpu-other 4

# v1.3.3+: --cpu-decode pins the audio/decode thread to its own core and
# raises it to SCHED_FIFO. If --cpu-decode is empty, the audio/decode
# thread inherits --cpu-other (v1.3.2 behaviour preserved).

# Tune buffer sizes (v1.3.0+)
sudo ./slim2diretta --target 1 --pcm-buffer-seconds 1.0 --dsd-buffer-seconds 1.2
```

## Architecture

```
LMS (network)
  -> slim2diretta (single process)
    -> SlimprotoClient (TCP port 3483) : control
    -> HttpStreamClient (port 9000) : encoded audio stream
    -> Decoder (FLAC/PCM/DSD — native or FFmpeg backend)
    -> DirettaSync (ring buffer + SDK)
      -> Diretta Target (UDP/Ethernet)
        -> DAC
```

**Threading**: main (init/signals) + slimproto (TCP LMS) + audio (HTTP->decode->push) + SDK worker (DirettaSync internal)

**SDK control serialization** (v1.4.11+): the slimproto/main threads and the audio thread both drive `DirettaSync` playback control, so all control entry points — `open`, `stopPlayback`, `pausePlayback`, `resumePlayback`, `startPlayback`, `release` — hold `m_controlMutex` (a `std::recursive_mutex`) for their whole body. This guarantees the SDK's `stop()`/`clear()`/`play()` are never driven by two threads at once. Without it, a rapid seek (`strm-q` → `stopPlayback()` on the slimproto thread) could race the audio thread's in-flight `open()` quick-resume, deadlocking an SDK call so the audio thread never returned and the unbounded `audioTestThread.join()` in the seek handler froze the whole slimproto loop (freeze required a service restart; only triggered by seeks <~2 s apart). Recursive so nested control calls (`startPlayback`→`resumePlayback`, `open`→`close`) don't self-lock; it is the outermost lock (`m_configMutex`/`m_workerMutex` are taken only inside it) and the SDK worker / `RingAccessGuard` / `beginReconfigure` never take it, so worker joins and reconfigure barriers always complete — no new deadlock. Lives in the shared `diretta/` layer, so it protects any front-end (e.g. DirettaRendererUPnP) from the same concurrent-control race.

**SDK 150.x connection stall fix (v1.4.21)**: two bugs in `diretta/DirettaSync.{h,cpp}`, ported from the confirmed fix on DirettaRendererUPnP v2.5.15 (PR #89) — same bridge architecture, same bugs. (1) `statusUpdate() override` was an empty stub (`{}`), silently swallowing the base class's notification that `Sync::connectWait()` waits on; DRUP's packet capture during a live stall showed the actual UDP negotiation completing and streaming normally within ~1s the entire time — `connectWait()` was simply never woken up. Fixed by chaining to the base: `void statusUpdate() override { DIRETTA::Sync::statusUpdate(); }`. (2) `configureSinkPCM()`/`configureSinkDSD()` called `setSinkConfigure()` *before* `setSink()` — wrong order per Yu Harada ("if you call `Sync::setSink`, you must also call `Sync::setSinkConfigure`" — after, not before); SDK 149's own uninitialized-flag bug tolerated it, SDK 150 fixed that flag and exposed the ordering bug. Now deferred via a new `m_pendingSinkFormat` member, applied once via `setSinkConfigure()` right after `setSink()` succeeds in `open()`. Both fixes are in the shared `diretta/` layer. **Unlike DRUP, not yet verified against real hardware for slim2diretta** — this is an untested port of a confirmed-working fix.

**Memory locking** (v1.4.0+): `main()` calls `mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE)` once it's past the immediate-exit cases and before any thread is created. All current and future process pages are pinned in RAM for the lifetime of the binary — closes the last non-deterministic stall source (page fault from swap, cache eviction, or zero-fill on first write) that SCHED_FIFO + CPU pinning + isolcpus cannot prevent on their own. Same discipline as JACK / PipeWire in RT mode. Requires `CAP_IPC_LOCK` and `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` — both satisfied by `slim2diretta.service` (root + the limit is set). On `EPERM` a `LOG_WARN` is emitted and the binary continues.

**CPU affinity** (`--cpu-audio`, `--cpu-decode`, `--cpu-other`): optional thread pinning via `pthread_setaffinity_np`, default empty (no pinning). Since v1.3.0 each option accepts either a single core (`3`) or a comma-separated list (`3,4`). Three-tier model aligned with DirettaRendererUPnP v2.4.2:

- `--cpu-audio` pins the SDK worker thread and is also passed to `DIRETTA::Sync::open(cpuMain, cpuOther, ...)` — the SDK only takes a single core, so the first value from the list is used; the `OCCUPIED` flag (bit 16) is added to threadMode automatically when `cpuAudio` is non-empty.
- `--cpu-decode` (v1.3.3+) pins the audio/decode thread (HTTP receive → decode → push to ring buffer). When set, that thread is also raised to `SCHED_FIFO` priority via `g_rtPriority`, since the dedicated core makes that safe. Falls back to `--cpu-other` when empty (preserves v1.3.2 behaviour).
- `--cpu-other` pins the main thread and the Slimproto TCP receive thread. Also serves as fallback target for the audio/decode thread when `--cpu-decode` is empty.

All three options are exposed via CLI and Web UI (CPU Affinity group, `cli_opts` config_type).

**Buffer configuration** (v1.3.0+): `--pcm-buffer-seconds`, `--dsd-buffer-seconds`, `--pcm-prefill-ms`, `--dsd-prefill-ms`. Zero/empty means "use defaults" from the `DirettaBuffer` namespace. The override is applied in `configureRingPCM()`, `configureRingDSD()`, and `calculateAlignedPrefill()`. Exposed via CLI and Web UI (Buffer Configuration group).

**Startup**: Both Diretta target discovery and LMS autodiscovery retry indefinitely:
- `discoverTarget()` retries every 2s (log every 5s) until found or cancelled. Pass `std::atomic<bool>* stopSignal` to `enable()` to activate retry mode.
- LMS autodiscovery (when no `-s` is specified) retries every 2s in a `while(g_running)` loop until LMS responds. Ctrl+C cancels cleanly.

**Key Components**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main.cpp` | Entry point, CLI, signal handling, logging init |
| `src/Config.h` | Configuration struct |
| `src/PlayerController.cpp/h` | Orchestrator: state machine, thread coordination |
| `src/SlimprotoClient.cpp/h` | Slimproto TCP protocol client |
| `src/SlimprotoMessages.h` | Binary protocol message structs |
| `src/HttpStreamClient.cpp/h` | HTTP audio stream fetcher |
| `src/Decoder.h` | Decoder abstract interface |
| `src/FlacDecoder.cpp/h` | FLAC decoder (libFLAC) |
| `src/PcmDecoder.cpp/h` | PCM/WAV/AIFF header parser |
| `src/Mp3Decoder.cpp/h` | MP3 decoder (libmpg123, optional) |
| `src/OggDecoder.cpp/h` | Ogg Vorbis decoder (libvorbisfile, optional) |
| `src/AacDecoder.cpp/h` | AAC decoder (fdk-aac, optional) |
| `src/FfmpegDecoder.cpp/h` | FFmpeg decoder backend (libavcodec, optional) |
| `src/DsdProcessor.cpp/h` | DSD conversions (interleaved->planar, DoP->native) |
| `diretta/DirettaSync.cpp/h` | Diretta SDK wrapper (shared with squeeze2diretta) |
| `diretta/DirettaRingBuffer.h` | Lock-free SPSC ring buffer |
| `diretta/globals.cpp/h` | Logging configuration |
| `diretta/LogLevel.h` | Centralized log level system |
| `diretta/FastMemcpy*.h` | SIMD memory operations |

**Web UI** (`webui/`):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `webui/diretta_webui.py` | HTTP server (custom BaseHTTPRequestHandler, no framework) |
| `webui/config_parser.py` | Config parsers: `ShellVarConfig` (KEY=VALUE) and `CliOptsConfig` (CLI args) |
| `webui/profiles/slim2diretta.json` | Product profile defining settings groups and field types |
| `webui/templates/index.html` | HTML template with embedded JavaScript |
| `webui/static/style.css` | Minimal CSS styling |
| `webui/slim2diretta-webui.service` | Systemd service (port 8081) |

**Save-time normalization** (v1.4.2+): setting JSON declarations carry an optional `"normalize"` field; `save_settings()` in `webui/diretta_webui.py` builds a `{key: rule}` map from the active profile once and canonicalises each matching value before splitting between `CliOptsConfig.save` (CLI opts → `SLIM2DIRETTA_OPTS`) and `ShellVarConfig.save` (shell vars as separate `KEY=VALUE` lines) paths. Currently the only supported rule is `comma_list` (`re.sub(r'\s*,\s*', ',', value.strip())`, idempotent, safe for empty strings and non-string values). Marked fields: `cpu-audio`, `cpu-decode`, `cpu-other`, `IRQ_INTERFACE`, `IRQ_CPUS` (full profile); `cpu-audio`, `cpu-decode`, `cpu-other` (minimal). Functionally a no-op — the shell launcher trims defensively per-element via `tr -d ' '` — but the on-disk value now matches the documented form. Symmetric to DirettaRendererUPnP v2.5.3 (the two web UIs share an identical Python codebase).

**Startup & Install**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `start-slim2diretta.sh` | Startup wrapper: reads `/etc/default/slim2diretta`, applies priority, link tuning (`ethtool`), IRQ affinity, SMT toggle, then `eval exec` |
| `install.sh` | Interactive installer (binary, service, webui) — pulls `ethtool` as a base dep so the wrapper-level link tuning works out of the box |
| `slim2diretta.service` | Main systemd service |

**Wrapper-level audiophile tuning (v1.3.0, mirrored from DirettaRendererUPnP v2.4.0)**: three system-wide tweaks applied by `start-slim2diretta.sh` before launching the binary, all configured via shell vars in `/etc/default/slim2diretta` and exposed in the web UI under "Advanced System & Network Tuning":

- `TARGET_INTERFACE` / `TARGET_SPEED` / `TARGET_DUPLEX` → forces NIC link via `ethtool -s`. `ethtool` missing is a non-fatal warning.
- `IRQ_INTERFACE` / `IRQ_CPUS` → walks `/proc/interrupts`, writes each `/proc/irq/N/smp_affinity_list` for IRQs whose name contains any interface listed in `IRQ_INTERFACE` (single name or comma-separated, e.g. `"enp1s0,enp2s0"` for a host with one NIC for LMS upstream and one for the Diretta target). Matches MSI-X queues like `enpXsY-rx-0`. Kernel-managed IRQs that refuse runtime reassignment are reported as "skipped".
- `SMT` (`on` / `off` / `forceoff` / empty) → writes `/sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control`. BIOS lock or unsupported control is a non-fatal warning. Toggle is non-persistent across kernel reboots; the wrapper re-applies it on each service start. Note: SMT changes the logical-CPU numbering, so `--cpu-audio` / `--cpu-other` values must be valid in the chosen state.

## Slimproto Protocol

Implemented from public documentation (wiki.lyrion.org, SlimDevices wiki). Reference implementations consulted: Rust slimproto crate (MIT), Ada slimp (MIT). **No code copied from squeezelite (GPL v3).**

Key messages: HELO (registration), STAT (status), strm (stream control), audg (volume - forced 100%), setd (device name).

## Dependencies

- **Diretta Host SDK v147 through v150** (proprietary, not committed, personal use). Current at time of writing: v150 — source/API-compatible at the compile level (builds and links cleanly, no code changes needed there; the only breaking API change between v149 and v150 was in `SyncBuffer`, a class this codebase never uses since it inherits `DIRETTA::Sync` directly), **but SDK 150 exposed a real runtime bug**: a ~50s connection stall, fixed in v1.4.21 — see "SDK 150.x connection stall fix" above. Auto-detected at CMake configure time via `Host/Release.hpp` parsing — newer releases that preserve the same header layout will be picked up automatically. v149+ ships each arch variant built with both GCC15 and GCC16 (`-DARCH_NAME=`); CMake warns if the system gcc is older than the selected variant's GCC major version (only for GCC16+, since GCC15-vs-older-system has years of proven field use — see build commands above and issue #10).
- **libFLAC** (BSD-3-Clause) for FLAC decoding
- **POSIX threads** (pthreads)
- **C++17 runtime**
- **Optional**: libmpg123 (MP3), libvorbis (Ogg), fdk-aac (AAC)
- **Optional**: libavcodec + libavutil (FFmpeg decoder backend, `--decoder ffmpeg`)

SDK locations searched (in order, newest version preferred — each version's full path list is tried before falling back to the next, so builders who haven't updated their SDK yet keep working against whatever they actually have installed, no action needed):
1. `$DIRETTA_SDK_PATH`
2. `~/DirettaHostSDK_150`, `~/DirettaHostSDK_149`, `~/DirettaHostSDK_148`, `~/DirettaHostSDK_147`
3. `./DirettaHostSDK_150`, `./DirettaHostSDK_149`, `./DirettaHostSDK_148`, `./DirettaHostSDK_147`
4. `/opt/DirettaHostSDK_150`, `/opt/DirettaHostSDK_149`, `/opt/DirettaHostSDK_148`, `/opt/DirettaHostSDK_147`


## Audio Push Strategy

The audio thread (in `main.cpp`) handles HTTP reading, decoding, and ring buffer pushing in a single thread. Key constants and patterns:

- **MAX_DECODE_FRAMES = 1024**: Decoder reads (adapts to libFLAC frame sizes)
- **PUSH_CHUNK_FRAMES = 2048**: Push to DirettaSync in multi-chunk loop (up to 4×2048 = 8192 frames per iteration)
- **Multi-chunk push**: At high sample rates (176.4kHz DoP, 192kHz+), a single 1024-frame push per loop yields insufficient throughput; the loop pushes as many chunks as possible while buffer has space
- **sendAudio return value**: All push sites use the return value (input bytes consumed) to advance `decodeCachePos` — prevents data loss when ring buffer is near-full. Normal rates (≤176kHz) use single 1024-frame push per iteration; multi-chunk only for high rates
- **Flow control**: 1ms sleep when buffer >95% full, loop back to HTTP read to keep TCP pipeline flowing
- **Decode cache**: Up to 9.2M samples with compaction every 500k consumed samples
- **Prebuffer**: 500ms normal, 3000ms for ≥176.4kHz
- **Ring buffer sizing**: 3.0s normal (PCM_BUFFER_SECONDS, raised from 0.5s in v1.2.5 for CDN resilience), 6.0s for ≥176.4kHz (PCM_HIGHRATE_BUFFER_SECONDS). HIGHRATE_THRESHOLD = 176000
- **SDK prefill**: 500ms PCM (raised from 50ms in v1.2.5), 800ms compressed / 500ms uncompressed (raised from 200/100ms)
- **Adaptive rebuffering**: 50% refill threshold after underrun (raised from 20% in v1.2.5) — more resilient recovery when Qobuz/Tidal CDN delivery stalls. High-rate streams use the same 50% threshold for ~4.2s headroom
- **Drain loop safeguard (v1.2.5)**: Drain loop bails out when the Diretta target is no longer open (auto-released after 5s idle) to prevent 100% CPU spin. Defensive 5ms sleep on `framesWritten==0`
- **Format-detection stall safety net (v1.4.9)**: the audio thread's HTTP-read / format-detection loop has a 10s timeout (`FORMAT_DETECT_TIMEOUT_MS`). If a stream connects but never yields a decodable format within the window (LMS/CDN leaves the HTTP stream open but sends no data — observed after rapid seeks), the thread sends `STMn`, disconnects, clears any pending track, sets `audioThreadDone`, and returns — so the next `strm-s` cold-starts fresh instead of the loop spinning forever (which previously froze playback until a manual service restart). PCM/FLAC path only; unchanged behaviour, kept as-is since it's a proven fix for a specific bug (rapid seeks).
- **Mid-stream stall recovery (v1.4.15)**: closes the gap the entry above didn't cover — a stall *after* the format is known and playback has started (e.g. LMS relaying internet radio whose upstream hiccups without LMS closing the socket: the TCP connection stays alive via keepalives, `HttpStreamClient::readWithTimeout()` just keeps returning 0, and the old code spun forever with no recovery). Covers both PCM/FLAC and DSD (DSD previously had *no* stall protection at all, not even pre-format-detection — this entry adds a single unified 5s/3-attempt timer for DSD covering both phases). On >5s of silence, `HttpStreamClient::reconnect()` (new method — replays the same server IP/port/HTTP request LMS supplied in the original `strm-s`, remembered internally since the caller no longer has them in scope inside the audio thread) re-establishes the connection, up to 3 attempts; giving up funnels into the same clean-abort path as the entry above (`STMn`, disconnect, clear pending, `audioThreadDone`, return). What happens to the decoder/reader after a successful reconnect depends on whether the format has a container to reparse: raw PCM (`format=p`, headerless) keeps feeding the same `Decoder` instance — the reconnected response is just a byte-stream continuation. Compressed containers (FLAC/MP3/OGG/AAC) and DSD (DSF/DFF headers) get a **fresh** decoder/`DsdStreamReader` instance and re-run format detection, since the reconnected HTTP response starts a brand-new container the old instance's mid-stream parser state can't make sense of; `DirettaSync`/the ring buffer (`direttaOpened`) is left untouched throughout. A `skipGaplessCompareOnRedetect` flag suppresses the PCM path's gapless same-format/format-change comparison during this re-detection — it's the same logical track reconnecting, not a chained next track, so no spurious `STMl` resend or cache drain. **Regression fixed in v1.4.16**: resetting `formatLogged` on the fresh compressed-format decoder without also resetting `formatDetectStart` left the *separate* pre-format-detection stall net (`FORMAT_DETECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, above) holding a stale timestamp from track start — on the next loop iteration it immediately saw `!formatLogged` past its (already-expired) 10s window and aborted the just-reconnected stream before it ever got a byte. Broke any compressed-container stream that hit a mid-stream reconnect (e.g. BBC iPlayer via LMS transcoding to AAC); raw PCM was unaffected since it never resets `formatLogged`. Fix: reset `formatDetectStart = steady_clock::now()` alongside `formatLogged = false` when the decoder is recreated. **Second regression fixed in v1.4.17**: the 5s stall timer only measured elapsed time since the last raw HTTP socket read, with no awareness of `decodeCache`'s depth. Lyrion's relay for BBC iPlayer (and presumably other plugin-backed internet radio) delivers AAC in bursts with gaps that regularly exceed 5s — normal for that source — but each gap was treated as a dead stream: HTTP reconnect + full decoder/format re-detection, audible as a click, even with 10+ seconds of cache still buffered (711,680 frames / ~14.8s observed in the field report). Fixed by gating the reconnect on actual buffer health, not just socket timing: `MIDSTREAM_STALL_MIN_CACHE_SEC = 3.0` — only reconnect once `cacheFrames() / audioFmt.sampleRate` has drained to ≤3s, regardless of how long the HTTP side has been quiet. A bursty-but-healthy source now plays straight through; a genuinely dead stream still recovers once the cache actually runs low. DSD's stall path is deliberately left alone — no equivalent deep cache exists there (planar buffer is consumed directly, no `decodeCache`), so raw-timing is the appropriate signal for that path.
- **Non-blocking `HttpStreamClient::readRaw()` (v1.4.12)**: the streaming recv uses `MSG_DONTWAIT` (EAGAIN → "no data this tick"). `readRaw()` is reached only via `readWithTimeout()`, which already `poll()`s, so nothing is lost on the normal path. It is essential for correctness: `m_socket` is lock-free, and on a rapid seek the Slimproto thread's `disconnect()` closes the fd (and the next `connect()` may reuse the number) *between* the `poll()` and the `recv()`; a blocking `recv()` then wedged the audio thread on the swapped/empty socket forever → it never re-checked `audioTestRunning` → the unbounded `audioTestThread.join()` in the seek handler froze the whole Slimproto loop (restart required; only triggered by seeks <~2 s apart). Header reads (`getResponseHeaders`, ICY skip) use a separate blocking recv path and are unchanged. Do not revert to a blocking recv here.

This pattern was aligned with DirettaRendererUPnP's audio engine for consistent delivery characteristics across both projects.

## ReplayGain / Digital Volume (v1.4.19, fixed v1.4.20)

Opt-in via `--enable-replaygain` (off by default — default behaviour is unchanged and remains strictly bit-perfect). Reported repeatedly by users (Didier/ds21 among others) that LMS's ReplayGain had no effect and there was no way to control volume digitally. Root cause: LMS doesn't bake ReplayGain into the PCM bytes it sends, even when transcoding — it sends the gain as a separate value over Slimproto, expecting the *player* to apply it:
- **`strm-s`'s per-track ReplayGain field** (`StrmCommand::getReplayGain()`, 16.16 fixed-point) — the accessor already existed (reused elsewhere for `p`/`u`/`t` sub-commands, where the same wire offset means "interval"/"timestamp") but was never called for `STRM_START`; the value was silently dropped. Now captured into `g_trackReplayGain` on every `STRM_START`. 0 = no ReplayGain info sent = treated as unity (never multiply by zero).
- **`audg`'s live user-volume gain** (`AudgCommand::getNewGainLeft/Right()`, 16.16 fixed-point per channel) — already parsed and callback-wired (`onVolume`), but explicitly a no-op ("ignored - bit-perfect"). Now applied **only when LMS's `dvc` (digital volume control) flag is set** — `dvc=0` means the user has LMS configured for analog/hardware volume control, and applying gain on top of that would double-attenuate; slim2diretta respects that choice and leaves the signal alone in that case regardless of the `--enable-replaygain` setting.

Both factors combine (`combineGainQ16()`, a 16.16×16.16 fixed-point multiply) into one gain applied via `applyReplayGain()` — round-to-nearest (`+0x8000` before the `>>16`, avoids the extra quantization noise a plain truncating shift adds) with saturation to `INT32_MIN/MAX`. No floating point in the hot path, consistent with the rest of the codebase. Stereo gets independent left/right gains (so `audg` balance comes through); other channel counts fall back to the left gain for every channel. Unity gain is a no-op fast path, so enabling the feature costs nothing on a track/volume combination that doesn't actually need adjustment.

**DSD is never affected regardless of this setting** — there is no bit-perfect way to scale a 1-bit delta-sigma stream, and DSD tracks never pass through `decodeCache`/`prepareForSend()` (the only place gain is applied).

**Gapless-transition race (caught and fixed before v1.4.19 shipped)**: `STRM_START` for the *next* queued track arrives on the Slimproto thread and can overwrite `g_trackReplayGain` while the audio thread is still draining the *current* track's tail (the post-EOF drain loop, run after `httpEof` but before the decoder reports `isFinished()`) — a few dozen milliseconds of the outgoing track's tail could otherwise get the incoming track's gain. Fixed by snapshotting `trackGainSnapshot = g_trackReplayGain.load()` once at the top of each track's own `while(true)` chaining-loop iteration. User-volume gain (`g_userGainLeft/Right`) is deliberately **not** snapshotted the same way — it's read live so a mid-track volume change still applies, matching how a real Squeezebox client behaves.

**Regression #1, fixed same-day (v1.4.20): heavy distortion.** v1.4.19 applied gain when decoding into `decodeCache`, using a plain round-to-nearest multiply on the full 32-bit sample. Every decoder in this codebase outputs MSB-aligned int32 PCM (real audio in the upper 3 bytes, low byte always zero — see FlacDecoder.cpp/PcmDecoder.cpp/FfmpegDecoder.cpp), and `DirettaRingBuffer::detectS24PackMode()` auto-detects 24-bit alignment by checking that low byte is reliably zero across a probe window — its own comment already named this exact risk ("digital volume applied to MSB-aligned data, introducing non-zero noise in the LSB byte"). The rounding smeared real precision into that byte, and confirmed on real hardware: heavy distortion, with volume control also seeming inert (the corruption dominated regardless of level). Fixed in `scaleGainQ16()` by masking the result's low byte to zero after the multiply — costs nothing audible (24-bit output only ever transmits the upper 3 bytes regardless of alignment, so that byte is discarded either way) and keeps the zero-padding invariant intact so the ambiguous-detection path is never reached at all.

**Regression #2, fixed same-day (v1.4.20): live volume changes took up to a minute to land.** Once the distortion above was fixed, Dominique found that changing volume mid-track only became audible after stopping and restarting the track from the beginning. Cause: gain was applied at decode time, into `decodeCache` — which can buffer nearly an entire CD-quality track ahead of playback (`DECODE_CACHE_MAX_SAMPLES`), so a live `audg` change only affected samples decoded *after* it, lagging behind by however deep the cache already was. Track ReplayGain itself was unaffected by this (fixed per track, doesn't need to be live), but live user-volume was effectively unusable. Fixed by moving gain application from decode time to send time: `decodeCache` now always stays gain-free, and a new `prepareForSend()` helper applies gain (only when actually needed — returns the source pointer unchanged otherwise, zero copy/compute cost) to a small staging buffer (`gainStagingBuf`, sized `GAIN_STAGING_FRAMES = 2048` to cover the largest single chunk used by any call site) immediately before each of the 4 `sendAudio()` call sites in the PCM/FLAC chaining loop (prebuffer flush, format-change drain, Phase 4 regular push, post-EOF drain). This bounds the lag to `DirettaSync`'s own (much shallower) buffer depth instead of `decodeCache`'s. Safe against partial `sendAudio()` writes since `decodeCache` is never mutated — a retry just re-copies and re-gains the same still-clean source frames from the advanced position, so no risk of double-applying gain.

## Decoder Routing

`Decoder::create()` in `Decoder.cpp` routes format codes to decoder implementations:
- **`format=p` (PCM/WAV/AIFF)**: Always uses native `PcmDecoder`, even when `--decoder ffmpeg` is active. PcmDecoder parses WAV/AIFF headers to detect the true sample rate, which is critical for high-rate files (e.g., 705600 Hz). The Slimproto `rate` field cannot encode rates above ~192kHz (sent as `rate=3` → 44100 Hz).
- **`format=d` (DSD)**: Always uses native DSD path (raw bitstream, not decoded).
- **`format=f` (FLAC), MP3, AAC, OGG**: Use FFmpeg when `--decoder ffmpeg` is active, native otherwise.

## FFmpeg Notes

**Parser flush at EOF**: `av_parser_parse2()` buffers partial codec frames; must flush with `(NULL, 0)` before flushing the decoder to recover the last audio frame (critical for gapless transitions).

**Raw PCM pitfalls** (historical — FFmpeg no longer handles raw PCM since v1.2.1):
- `block_align` is 0 without a demuxer: must be set explicitly
- PCM parser splits without respecting `block_align`: force `m_parser = nullptr`

## Bit Depth Handling

All decoders output **MSB-aligned int32_t** samples (4 bytes per sample in the ring buffer):
- 24-bit FLAC (libFLAC): `sample << 8` → upper 24 bits set, LSByte = 0x00
- 16-bit FLAC (libFLAC): `sample << 16` → upper 16 bits set, lower 2 bytes = 0x00
- FFmpeg (S32/S32P): FFmpeg decoders already produce MSB-aligned S32 output (FLAC shifts internally by `32-bps`, float codecs scale to full 32-bit range). No additional shift is needed — `m_s32Shift` was removed in v1.2.1.

`audioFmt.bitDepth` in `main.cpp` reflects the **source bit depth** (24 for ≤24-bit content, 32 otherwise). This drives two things:
1. **Diretta format negotiation** (`configureSinkPCM`): only offers 32-bit if source is ≥32-bit. Prevents white noise/silence on DACs that report 32-bit support at the Diretta target level but are physically limited to 24-bit. Both 16-bit and 24-bit sources open at 24-bit (`fmt.bitDepth <= 24`).
2. **Ring buffer input width** (`inputBps`): always 4 (int32_t), regardless of bit depth — derived from the `bitDepth == 32 || bitDepth == 24` formula.

`push24BitPacked` uses hybrid S24 auto-detection (MSB-aligned vs LSB-aligned), with `MsbAligned` hint always set for all our decoders.

**FFmpeg bit depth detection**: `bits_per_raw_sample` from FFmpeg is authoritative when set. When it is 0, raw PCM uses `m_rawBitDepth` (from the Slimproto strm command) — do NOT fall back to the `sample_fmt` heuristic for raw PCM, as S32 maps to 24 by default which corrupts 32-bit WAV data.

## DoP (DSD over PCM) Handling

Roon (and some LMS DSD plugins) send DSD as **DoP** over Slimproto with format code `p` (PCM). `detectDoP()` in `main.cpp` inspects the top byte (bits [31:24]) of the MSB-aligned int32 samples: DoP carries an alternating `0x05`/`0xFA` **marker per frame** (shared across channels) with the DSD payload in the next two bytes. When detected, `main.cpp` sets `audioFmt.isDSD = false`, `bitDepth = 24`, **`isDoP = true`** — the intact DoP frames are passed straight through the 24-bit PCM path to the DAC (matches DirettaRendererUPnP). `isDoP` is reset per track (PHASE 2 format setup) and re-detected in PHASE 3, since `audioFmt` persists across gapless tracks.

**DoP-aware silence (v1.4.3+)**: a DAC locked in DoP needs *valid DoP silence* during gaps, not `0x00`. Plain `0x00` breaks DoP framing (marker byte ≠ `0x05`/`0xFA`) and is not DSD idle (`0x69`), so the DAC drops DoP lock and emits a crack. The `isDoP` flag propagates to `DirettaSync` via `configureRingPCM(..., isDoP)` and the quick-resume fast path (both set `m_dopSilence`; `configureRingDSD` and the reset path clear it). `getNewStream()` emits silence through `fillSilence()`, which — when `m_cachedDopSilence` is set — writes valid DoP silence (24-bit LE packed: payload `0x69`, alternating markers) instead of `memset(0x00)`. Covers every silence site: quick-resume, shutdown silence, 5 s idle release, underrun/rebuffering. Only `getNewStream`'s silence reaches the DAC; the ring's internal `0x00` fill never does (`pop()` only returns real data).

**DoP continuity — the actual crackle fix (v1.4.4 / v1.4.5+)**: v1.4.3's valid silence was necessary but **not sufficient** — the crack on *manual* track change / FF / rewind persisted (automatic gapless was always clean). Root cause: a DoP DAC auto-detects DoP from the *continuous* marker stream, so any interruption makes it re-lock → pop. The decisive interruption is **upstream** of the quick-resume: on a manual seek Roon sends `strm-q` → `stopPlayback()` → SDK `stop()`, which breaks the marker stream before the new track even opens. (Automatic gapless never calls `stopPlayback()`; LMS uses the gapless path — hence both were clean.) Three `isDoP`-gated fixes:
- **`stopPlayback()` does not stop the SDK for DoP (v1.4.5)** — the key fix. For DoP it discards buffered audio under `beginReconfigure()`/`endReconfigure()` (so a later resume can't replay stale data) but keeps the SDK running, so `getNewStream()` keeps emitting continuous DoP silence — the marker stream survives the whole seek. A genuine stop (no `strm-s` follows) is handled by the existing 5 s idle `release()` → `close()` (DoP-valid shutdown silence, then clean SDK stop). PCM / native DSD keep the `stop()` path.
- **`pausePlayback()` / `resumePlayback()` do not stop/restart the SDK for DoP (v1.4.6)** — same fix for the pause path. `pausePlayback()` just sets `m_paused` and keeps the SDK running; `getNewStream()` has a DoP pause branch (gated on `m_cachedDopSilence && m_paused`) that emits continuous DoP silence without popping, so the DAC holds DoP lock for the whole pause. `resumePlayback()` discards the stale buffer under the barrier and re-prefills without calling `play()`. PCM / native DSD keep the `stop()`/`play()` pause path. With v1.4.5 + v1.4.6, every manual transport action (seek, FF, stop, pause) preserves DoP lock.
- **No stream interruption in quick-resume (v1.4.4)** — the same-format fast path keeps the SDK running for DoP and swaps the ring under the reconfigure barrier instead of `stop()`→`clear()`→`play()`. It calls `play()` only if the SDK was actually stopped (`m_playing == false`), so it can never hang (the v1.4.4 hang regression: it had skipped `play()` unconditionally).
- **Continuous marker phase (v1.4.4)** — `writeDopMarkers()` rewrites every output frame's marker byte (24-bit MSB) to a strictly alternating `0x05`/`0xFA` sequence, for **both** silence (`fillSilence`) and popped audio (after `m_ringBuffer.pop`), via a persistent `m_dopMarkerParity` shared across all paths. Eliminates the one-frame phase break at silence↔audio junctions (the residual tick seen under LMS). Safe because the marker carries no audio (DSD is in the low 16 bits) and the ring is always frame-aligned (the producer pushes whole stereo frames from track start, `clear()` resets to frame 0, and every pop/`bytesPerBuffer` is a multiple of `channels×3`), so rewriting marker parity on real audio is bit-transparent. Walks frames using the consumer-cached `m_cachedBytesPerFrame` (= channels×3).

## Hot-Path Performance

- **`DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC_FMT`**: RT-safe logging macro using `snprintf` on a stack-local `char[248]`. Used in `sendAudio` and `getNewStream` callbacks instead of `DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC` (which uses `std::ostringstream` → heap allocation). The legacy `DIRETTA_LOG_ASYNC` is kept for non-critical paths.
- **PcmDecoder read-offset**: `m_dataPos` advances through `m_dataBuf` instead of `vector::erase()` on every `readDecoded()` call. Compaction only when `m_dataPos >= 64KB` (`DATA_COMPACT_THRESHOLD`). Eliminates O(n) `memmove` from the decode hot path.

## Gapless Playback Strategy

- **Shared decode cache**: `decodeCache`, `decodeCachePos`, `direttaOpened`, `audioFmt` persist across gapless same-format tracks (outside the chaining `while(true)` loop)
- **Same-format continuation**: If next track has same sample rate and channels, skip Diretta close/reopen — just keep pushing to the ring buffer
- **Format change**: Drain remaining cache, close Diretta, reopen with new format
- **STMd timing**: Sent at HTTP EOF, but decode cache may still have seconds of audio buffered — LMS handles track counter advancement
- **Clean end-of-track**: After gapless wait timeout (no next track), `stopPlayback(false)` sends silence buffers before the ring buffer drains. Prevents underruns that Roon interprets as errors (refusing to start the next track). LMS tolerates underruns; Roon does not.
- **open() failure in gapless**: If `open()` fails during a format change in gapless chaining, `openFailedInGapless` flag prevents STMu from being sent after STMn. Without this, LMS receives STMn+STMu and skips to the next track.
- **Timed worker join**: `joinWorkerWithTimeout(1000ms)` replaces bare `m_workerThread.join()` in all format transition paths to prevent indefinite blocking when the SDK worker is unresponsive.
